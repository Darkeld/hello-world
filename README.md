# hello-world

Hi coders!

I'm Tommaso, an italian guy interested in coding, maths and competitive programming.
I'm here to discover the world of GitHub, get to learn the community and help others when possible.
I want to have more experiences in the software world and, why not, also make new friends.
My other passions are the Rubik's cube, playing the piano and videogames such as League of Legends.

See ya on GitHub!
